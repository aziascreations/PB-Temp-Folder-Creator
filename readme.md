# PureBasic Temporary Folder Creator

This program creates a folder in the current user's temporary directory and marks it for deletion at the next reboot and opens a file explorer window in it.

It requires Administrator rights to be able to mark the folder.


## Warning

There is just one thing that needs to be checked, when explorer.exe is launched, it might be launched with admin rights and that could lead to potential vulnerabilities in work environments.

Please check before using it while this section is still present in the readme.
